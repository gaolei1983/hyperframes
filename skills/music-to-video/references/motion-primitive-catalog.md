# Motion-primitive catalog — the free-compose menu

The atomic layer: one anchor → one micro-move. Templates ([`template-catalog.md`](template-catalog.md))
are built from these; when no template fits a group, the planner **free-composes** by naming
primitives from here, and the frame-worker realizes them. Two readers, one file:

- **Planner (Step 3)** — scan **what it does** + **anchor** to pick the primitives a free group rides. Selection only.
- **Frame-worker (Step 4)** — open the cited recipe and lift its tweens. Build only.

The **recipe** column says what to lift:

- **✓** — a runnable, lint-clean composition at `motion-primitives/<id>/index.html`. Open it and lift the tweens.
- **≈ `<id>`** — no separate file; use that recipe, it's the same idea.
- **—** — no file; implement inline from the description (a one-liner, e.g. a 0ms `tl.set`, or a move a template realizes internally).

## Timing & latency (applies to every primitive)

Quantified from frame-accurate reverse engineering of beat-synced reels:

- **Hard hits are 0ms.** Cuts, palette flips, content swaps, freezes are `tl.set(...)` with no duration — the percussion _is_ the motion. Easing a hit kills it.
- **Lead the anchor.** A move that must _land_ on a beat (a wipe covering the frame, a count-up locking, two blocks colliding) starts **~40–190ms early** so it completes ON the anchor. Reactive entrances (something appearing _because_ of the hit) fire 0–45ms after.
- **Eased entrances: 300–500ms** (scale punch, slides, camera pushes). **Macro builds: 800–2000ms** spanning a whole roll / silence.
- **Magnitudes:** scale-punch 0→1; weight pulse 1→1.06; hero fill up to 1→5; chromatic split ~20px, resolve clean in ≤150ms.
- **Per-bar caps:** one accumulating element per hit (not a burst); a camera move at most once per phrase, never per beat; a dense flip/strobe system runs ≤2–3s.
- **Tension-builds lock.** A count-up / sequential build / morph must _resolve on_ a downbeat or hard_stop, never trail off mid-bar.

## Catalog

Each runnable recipe is self-contained and lint-clean: showcase chrome stripped, system-font
fallback, shared `../assets/gsap.min.js`, one paused timeline on `window.__timelines["main"]`.

## How to combine

- One dominant system per group; layer at most one texture recipe over one structural recipe.
- Structure on strong beats (cuts, camera, `system-replace` → downbeat / phrase / section_start); texture on weak / syncopated hits (`content-swap`, typewriter letters, chromatic accents).
- A roll is an accumulation container — build during it, hard-cut to a clean layout on the downbeat that ends it.
- `drop` ≠ `downbeat`: a downbeat is a cut within the regime; a drop is a regime change (`system-replace`, total clear, element-count jump).
- Let silence remove density (`negative-space-hold`).
- **Background beds are a layer, not a move.** A bed (`bg-flow-field`) runs the whole span on the **energy / phrase** channel, leaving the **beat anchors** free for the foreground — so it composes cleanly _under_ any discrete primitive. One bed at a time; merge the bed's uniform tweens onto the group's master timeline (don't run a second timeline), bundle a local `three`/WebGL (no CDN), repaint via the timeline's `onUpdate` (no rAF).
- **WebGL "system" primitives come in two roles:** a **bed** (`bg-flow-field`, behind everything) and a **hero-text treatment** (`text-spectral-rays`, which rasterizes the wordmark and _is_ the hero). Use at most one of each; feed text/raster locally (no CDN fonts), repaint via `onUpdate`.
- **`text-spectral-rays` renders its OWN wordmark — never give the word a second source.** It draws the solid letters AND the rays from one glyph mask (perfectly registered). Do NOT use it as a "rays-only" layer behind a separate DOM logo (or stack `content-swap` / `chromatic-pressure` on the same word): the two fonts/positions won't match and you get a doubled / ghosted wordmark — deleting the shader's letter terms does not fix it (the ray mask is still the second, misaligned copy). Let the shader be the wordmark; hide any DOM logo (keep it only as an invisible layout spacer). If you move the word off frame-center, move the light cursor's `y` by the same amount.
